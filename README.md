## Convolution Neural Network(CNN) on MNIST Dataset

### MNIST digits classification dataset

<b>MNIST ("Modified National Institute of Standards and Technology")</b> is the de facto “hello world” dataset of computer vision. Since its release in 1999, this classic dataset of handwritten images has served as the basis for benchmarking classification algorithms. As new machine learning techniques emerge, MNIST remains a reliable resource for researchers and learners alike.


This is a dataset of 60,000 28x28 grayscale images of the 10 digits, along with a test set of 10,000 images.
